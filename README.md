### Creation of a CRUD system for English/French/Korean vocabulary using Laravel

Currently learning the Korean language, this small personal project was carried out to simply add new vocabulary words in a list in order to be able to see them all. In addition, it allowed me to understand the Laravel framework. [See more on my website](https://antoninwinterstein.com/vocabularylist).

<b>The project includes:</b>

- A home page showing the last words added in the form of a carousel as well as a way to generate a random word
- A vocabulary page showing all the words present in the database with the possibility of filtering the data in ascending/descending order of creation or randomly. But also according to the categories of words (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, other). Or simply via a search bar. There is also the possibility of creating, modifying or deleting a word
